# Committing Releases (RCW Extension)

This skill formalizes the release process for the Antigravity Agent Factory. It extends the Robust Commit Workflow (RCW) by adding automated semantic versioning and immutable git tagging.

## When to Use
- When completing a major feature phase (e.g., transition from Phase 5 to Phase 6).
- When a set of verified bugs or features needs to be bundled into a stable release.
- For managing production-ready snapshots of the factory.

## Prerequisites
- **High-Fidelity State**: All local changes must be ready for commitment.
- **Git Config**: User must have `git` configured with push access to remote.
- **Environment**: Must be running in the `cursor-factory` conda environment.

## Process

The release process is fully automated via the `safe_release.py` script.

### 1. Version Selection
Determine the bump type based on [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- `patch`: Bug fixes and minor maintenance.
- `minor`: New features, no breaking changes.
- `major`: Breaking changes or fundamental architectural shifts.

### 2. Automated Execution
Run the release script. This will automatically:
1. Extract the current version from `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version and date.
3. Run `safe_commit.py` (which runs full verification/smoke tests).
4. Create a signed/annotated git tag.
5. Push commit and tag to the remote repository.

```bash
# Example: Minor release (e.g., 1.6.0 -> 1.7.0)
conda run -p D:\Anaconda\envs\cursor-factory python scripts/git/safe_release.py --bump minor
```

### 3. Verification
After execution, verify:
- `git log --oneline --graph --decorate` shows the new tag.
- `CHANGELOG.md` contains the new version header.
- Remote repository reflects the new tag.

## Best Practices
- **Never manual bump**: Always use `safe_release.py` to ensure the `CHANGELOG.md` and `git tag` are perfectly synchronized.
- **Verification First**: The script depends on `safe_commit.py`. If tests fail, the release will be aborted. Fix all failures before releasing.
- **Informative Changelogs**: Ensure that recent changes are properly documented in the draft section of `CHANGELOG.md` before running the release.
- **Tag Signing**: (Future) Enable GPG signing for release tags for non-repudiation.
