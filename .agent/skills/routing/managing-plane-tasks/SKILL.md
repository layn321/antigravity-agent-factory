# Remote Plane Management (MCP)

This skill enables agents to manage projects, issues, and states in a remote Plane PMS instance using the **Plane MCP server**. Every task created follows a **formal task definition schema** that links the work item to specific factory assets — workflows, agents, skills, scripts, knowledge, patterns, templates, blueprints, and tests.

> [!NOTE]
> Every task is a **hypothesis** about which factory assets best solve the defined problem. The schema formalizes context engineering — giving agents immediate, situation-adequate consciousness of available tools, techniques, and methodologies. See [Task Definition Guide](file:///d:/Users/wpoga/Documents/Python%20Scripts/antigravity-agent-factory/.agent/skills/routing/managing-plane-tasks/references/task_definition_guide.md) for the full philosophy.

## When to Use
- When you need to create, update, or track tasks in the hosted Plane instance.
- For all standard project lifecycle automation (refinement, updates, reporting).
- When a pure, standardized, and- **Automation**: Use `create_task.py` to maintain visual consistency across all issues.

## Project State Mapping (UUIDs)

| State | UUID |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Backlog** | `294ddb00-19ce-4ffe-9eac-2fd4e998d7f8` |
| **Todo** | `8e155185-58ad-404b-8458-6a7c9edbf09b` |
| **In Progress** | `d89aabd2-46d4-4f46-8ce4-eb49e06cac03` |
| **Done** | `ef4b2395-3edb-41e9-adcd-7ec77d534f0f` |
| **Cancelled** | `0723fa1c-6935-4661-a873-f5295203e58c` |

## Prerequisites
- **Plane MCP Server**: Must be active and configured in `mcp_config.json`.
- **Memory MCP Server**: Must be active for knowledge graph queries during task planning.
- **Project Context**: Project ID `e71eb003-87d4-4b0c-a765-a044ac5affbe` | Identifier `AGENT`.
- **Label Synchronization**: Always adhere to the project's global [Label Governance](#label-governance-source-of-truth).

## Process

Follow this end-to-end workflow for all Plane project management operations.

### 1. Listing & Discovery
Use `mcp_plane_list_work_items` with appropriate filtering. Prefer `expand` for full metadata.

```json
// Tool: mcp_plane_list_work_items
{
  "project_id": "e71eb003-87d4-4b0c-a765-a044ac5affbe",
  "expand": "labels,state,assignees",
  "order_by": "-updated_at"
}
```

### 2. Detailed Inspection
Retrieve the full details of a specific item, including description and comments.

```json
// Tool: mcp_plane_retrieve_work_item
{
  "project_id": "e71eb003-87d4-4b0c-a765-a044ac5affbe",
  "work_item_id": "UUID-OR-IDENTIFIER"
}
```

### 3. Professional Task Creation (Mandatory Workflow)

A work item is **NOT considered created** until ALL mandatory steps (A through C) are complete. **No exceptions.**

> [!CAUTION]
> Creating a work item without start_date, target_date, estimate, labels, module, cycle, and task schema is a governance violation. Always complete the full workflow.

#### Step 0: Context Engineering (Memory-First Navigation)

**MANDATORY**: Before defining a task, query the memory MCP knowledge graph. This is the **Factory Standard** for building situational awareness. Establish the "Memory-First" pattern to ensure your task hypothesis is grounded in actual factory capabilities.

```json
// Tool: mcp_memory_open_nodes — Start with system orientation
{ "names": ["System_Consciousness"] }
```

Use this information to **form your hypothesis**: which workflows, agents, skills, scripts, knowledge, and patterns will best solve the problem?

#### Pre-Flight Checklist
Before calling `create_task.py`, resolve ALL of the following UUIDs via MCP:

| Property | How to Resolve | Required |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| `labels` | `mcp_plane_list_labels` → copy the uppercase names | ✅ |
| `start_date` / `target_date` | Determine accurate ISO 8601 dates (e.g., `"2026-03-03"`) | ✅ |
| `estimate_point` | Use Fibonacci scale UUID from [Estimate Points](#estimate-points-fibonacci-scale) | ✅ |
| `parent` | If item belongs to an Epic, use UUID from [Known Active Epics](#known-active-epics) | ⚠️ If applicable |
| `module_id` | Use UUID from [Known Active Modules](#known-active-modules) | ✅ |
| `cycle_id` | `mcp_plane_list_cycles` → find the currently active sprint | ✅ |

#### Step A: Generate and Create Task via Jinja Template
Create a `task.json` definition file on disk. Include the core requirements, factory assets (the task schema), AND the execution context.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Strict Asset Comprehensiveness Rule:** You MUST ALWAYS be absolutely comprehensive when filling out `workflows`, `agents`, `skills`, and `templates` in the `task.json`. Do not just include 1 or 2 skills if 5 are relevant. If a template is used, list it. The visual representation in Plane acts as the definitive routing map for agents, so it must be exhaustive.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Mandatory Epic Rule:** You MUST ALWAYS provide a `parent` (Epic) UUID. No task should ever be orphaned in the backlog without an Epic. If you do not know the Epic, scan existing tickets in the same domain to find the UUID.

The execution context fields (`start_date`, `target_date`, `estimate_point`, `parent`) are sent directly to the Plane API so they appear natively in the UI.

**Example `task.json`:**
```json
{
  "name": "FEATURE: Implement Analyst Society",
  "type": "feature",
  "priority": "high",
  "labels": ["FEATURE", "CORE"],

  "start_date": "2026-03-03",
  "target_date": "2026-03-09",
  "estimate_point": "bd9e29aa-b4e8-4525-b16d-893c8324f7c7",
  "parent": "e18df34b-2da0-46a7-bca2-594ca70757c0",

  "requirements": ["Must support nested loops"],
  "acceptance_criteria": ["Nested loops work to depth 3"],
  "workflows": ["feature-development"],
  "agents": ["python-ai-specialist"],
  "skills": ["managing-plane-tasks"],
  "tests": [
    { "type": "unit", "script": "test_loops.py", "expected": "Pass" }
  ]
}
```

Run the creation script to render the HTML and apply the task natively:
```bash
conda run -p D:\Anaconda\envs\cursor-factory python .agent/skills/routing/managing-plane-tasks/scripts/create_task.py --json task.json
```
*Note: The script outputs the new `UUID` of the created task. You will need this for Steps B and C.*

#### Step B: Mandatory Module Association (at least 1 module)

Use the Plane MCP server tools to assign the created task to its context module.

```json
// Tool: mcp_plane_add_work_items_to_module
{
  "project_id": "e71eb003-87d4-4b0c-a765-a044ac5affbe",
  "module_id": "9a86f2c8-1ffe-448c-ac2e-82196fba4afa",
  "issue_ids": ["NEW-ISSUE-UUID"]
}
```

<a name="known-active-modules"></a>
**Known Active Modules:**
| Module Name | UUID |
| :--- | :--- |
| **agent system** | `9a86f2c8-1ffe-448c-ac2e-82196fba4afa` |
| **statistical dashboard** | `a4123817-7b59-474a-b4d2-7d0fcb3d3fc9` |
| **plane integration** | `d2ea0dc7-0b89-48c7-b902-26e46a35d6ba` |
| **rag system** | `4071283a-7135-4ef8-a61b-020cdef79a02` |

#### Step C: Mandatory Cycle Association

Use the Plane MCP server tools to assign the created task to the active cycle.

```json
// Tool: mcp_plane_add_work_items_to_cycle
{
  "project_id": "e71eb003-87d4-4b0c-a765-a044ac5affbe",
  "cycle_id": "ACTIVE-CYCLE-UUID",
  "issue_ids": ["NEW-ISSUE-UUID"]
}
```

> [!TIP]
> Always use `mcp_plane_list_cycles` to find the currently active sprint. Do not hardcode cycle UUIDs — they change every sprint.

### 4. High-Fidelity Solution Reporting (Mandatory Closure)

Every issue marked as **Done** MUST be accompanied by a professional solution summary rendered via the `solution_comment.html.j2` template. This ensures technical fidelity and prevents shallow, uninformative closures.

**MANDATORY SCHEMA**: See [solution_definition_schema.json](file:///d:/Users/wpoga/Documents/Python%20Scripts/antigravity-agent-factory/.agent/skills/routing/managing-plane-tasks/references/solution_definition_schema.json).

#### Step D: Prepare High-Fidelity Solution Data
You must separate *what* you did (mechanics) from *why* you did it (architecture).

⚠️ **CRITERIA FOR A GOOD SOLUTION DEFINITION**
- **Poor (The "Alibi Blablabla")**: "Updated script. Fixed whitespace. Ran tests."
- **Excellent (Architectural Insight)**: "Introduced a `post_solution.py` script bridging the Plane API with Jinja2 rendering. Decided to filter empty whitespace natively inside the Jinja template using `-set` blocks to offload cleaning logic from Python, ensuring clean HTML payloads."

**Example `solution.json`:**
```json
{
  "summary": "Isolated RAG workspaces for parallel CI workers to prevent file locking and SQLite corruption during `pytest -n 2`.",
  "architectural_decisions": [
    "Implemented `isolated_rag_workspace` fixture using pytest `tmp_path_factory`.",
    "Bypassed the global `data/` directory entirely for CI runs to prevent process collisions.",
    "Decided to patch `OptimizedRAG` initialization path dynamically rather than relying on env vars to maintain thread safety."
  ],
  "files_affected": [
    "scripts/ai/rag/rag_optimized.py",
    "tests/conftest.py"
  ],
  "verification": [
    { "type": "Parallel Smoke Test", "result": "PASS" }
  ],
  "evolution": [
    "Added CI parallelization blueprint.",
    "Removed toxic data blobs from Git.",
    "Stabilized standard factory CI/CD."
  ]
}
```

> [!CAUTION]
> The `post_solution.py` script contains strict minimum-length validations. If your descriptions are too short or lack architectural depth, the script will crash and block the task closure. Provide extreme technical depth.

#### Step E: Render and Post Solution
Use the `post_solution.py` script to automate the rendering and posting to Plane. This script also moves the issue to the **Done** state.

```bash
conda run -p D:\Anaconda\envs\cursor-factory python .agent/skills/routing/managing-plane-tasks/scripts/post_solution.py \
    --issue AGENT-48 \
    --json solution.json \
    --close
```

## Best Practices
- **Memory-First**: Always query memory MCP (Step 0) before creating tasks to build situational awareness.
- **Hypothesis-Driven**: Treat each task as a hypothesis — declare which assets solve the problem, then validate with tests.
- **Always resolve metadata first**: Use `mcp_plane_list_labels`, `mcp_plane_list_states`, `mcp_plane_get_me` before creating work items.
- **Complete all five steps**: A work item is not finished until Steps A–E are complete (creation, module, cycle, epic, schema, and solution reporting).
- **Use expand for context**: When listing or retrieving items, use `expand: "labels,state,assignees"` for full metadata.
- **Never hardcode cycle UUIDs**: Always query `mcp_plane_list_cycles` — cycles change every sprint.
- **Document closures professionally**: Use `post_solution.py` to provide a technical summary, files affected, and verification proof.
- **Respect label governance**: Only use labels from the synchronized set.
- **Create missing assets**: If a task needs a skill, agent, or workflow that doesn't exist, use the `[NEW]` prefix and build it during execution.
- **Evolve the knowledge graph**: After completing tasks, update both knowledge files and memory MCP entities with learnings.
